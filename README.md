A simple implementation of the Android In-App Billing API.

It supports: in-app purchases (both consumable and non-consumable) and subscriptions with a base plan or multiple offers.

# Getting Started!

* You project should build against Android 4.1.x (minSdkVersion 16).

* Add the JitPack repository to your project's build.gradle file:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

* Add the dependency in your app's build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.moisoni97:google-inapp-billing:1.1.3'
}
```

* Open the AndroidManifest.xml of your application and add this permission:

```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```

# Important Notice

* For builds that use `minSdkVersion` lower than `24` it is very important to include the following in your app's build.gradle file:

```gradle
android {
  compileOptions {
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true

    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
  }
}

dependencies {
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
}
```

* For builds that use `minSdkVersion` lower than `21` add the above and also this:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
}
```

This step is required to enable support for some APIs on lower SDK versions that aren't available natively only starting from `minSdkVersion 24`.

# Usage

* Create an instance of BillingConnector class. Constructor will take 2 parameters:
  - *Context*
  - *License key from `Play Console`*

```java
billingConnector = new BillingConnector(this, "license_key")
                .setConsumableIds(consumableIds)
                .setNonConsumableIds(nonConsumableIds)
                .setSubscriptionIds(subscriptionIds)
                .autoAcknowledge()
                .autoConsume()
                .enableLogging()
                .connect();
```

* Implement the listener to handle event results and errors:

```java
billingConnector.setBillingEventListener(new BillingEventListener() {
            @Override
            public void onProductsFetched(@NonNull List<ProductInfo> productDetails) {
                /*Provides a list with fetched products*/
            }

            @Override
            public void onPurchasedProductsFetched(@NonNull ProductType productType, @NonNull List<PurchaseInfo> purchases) {
                /*Provides a list with fetched purchased products*/
                
                /*
                 * This will be called even when no purchased products are returned by the API
                 * */
            }

            @Override
            public void onProductsPurchased(@NonNull List<PurchaseInfo> purchases) {
                /*Callback after a product is purchased*/
            }

            @Override
            public void onPurchaseAcknowledged(@NonNull PurchaseInfo purchase) {
                /*Callback after a purchase is acknowledged*/
                
                /*
                 * Grant user entitlement for NON-CONSUMABLE products and SUBSCRIPTIONS here
                 *
                 * Even though onProductsPurchased is triggered when a purchase is successfully made
                 * there might be a problem along the way with the payment and the purchase won't be acknowledged
                 *
                 * Google will refund users purchases that aren't acknowledged in 3 days
                 *
                 * To ensure that all valid purchases are acknowledged the library will automatically
                 * check and acknowledge all unacknowledged products at the startup
                 * */
            }

            @Override
            public void onPurchaseConsumed(@NonNull PurchaseInfo purchase) {
                /*Callback after a purchase is consumed*/
                
                /*
                 * Grant user entitlement for CONSUMABLE products here
                 *
                 * Even though onProductsPurchased is triggered when a purchase is successfully made
                 * there might be a problem along the way with the payment and the user will be able consume the product
                 * without actually paying
                 * */
            }

            @Override
            public void onBillingError(@NonNull BillingConnector billingConnector, @NonNull BillingResponse response) {
                /*Callback after an error occurs*/
                
                switch (response.getErrorType()) {

        });
```

# Initiate a purchase

* Purchase a non-consumable/consumable product:

```java
billingConnector.purchase(this, "product_id");
```

* Purchase a subscription with a base plan:

```java
billingConnector.subscribe(this, "product_id");
```

* Purchase a subscription with multiple offers:

```java
billingConnector.subscribe(this, "product_id", 0);
billingConnector.subscribe(this, "product_id", 1);
```

* Cancel a subscription:

```java
billingConnector.unsubscribe(this, "product_id");
```

# Release instance

* To avoid memory leaks don't forget to release the BillingConnector instance when it's no longer needed.

```java
@Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        if (billingConnector != null) {
            billingConnector.release();
        }
    }
```

# Kotlin

`Kotlin` is interoperable with `Java` and vice versa. This library works without any issues in `Kotlin` projects.

The sample app provides an example for `Kotlin` users.

# Sample App

Go through the sample app to see a more advanced integration of the library. 

It also shows how to implement some `useful public methods`.

# Credits

This is an open-source project meant to help developers to fastly and easily implement the Google Billing API.

The library uses a code base from a fork created by [@Mustafa Rasheed](https://github.com/MRZ07) and was heavily modified by me and later by other contributors.
